## Channel Log
Ho ho ho! v4.1 (17-12) is here! Just head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/FriendsNone/FunctionKey-Bot/releases) tab for some channel log goodness!

Welcome to this part of the `README.md`, where you can run your very own copy of Function Key!

This part shows you the required dependencies and the installation process.
